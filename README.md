# EmotionSenseAI
EmotionSenseAI is a Python-Deep Learning based project that uses concolutional beural networks to build a model and train a model to detect human emotions in live video. . Leveraging a pre-trained model and OpenCV for facial detection and Haar cascade for face detection. 


Libraried need to be installed :
Tensorflow |
Keras |
Numpy |
Pandas |
OpenCV
Need to have basic knowledge of deep learning to understand the core part of the project including building convolution neural network to extract the features from the fed data. The process include pooling, padding, data pre-processing and adding multiple hidden layers to learn intricate patters from the provided dataset.
